# Procedural Version

print("Hello World")

# Simple method to call the print function, this would be
# deemed a procedural method. It occurs in a sequence of one.

# For fun, we can add additional checks...
x = 1           # Add some additional code, this file looks barren without it.
if x == 1:
    print("Hello World")
    pass
